# @ptah/dualshock

Dualshock is the tiny bi-directional RPC implementation used to empower services ran by Ptah.sh.

Currently only WebSockets are supported as a transport layer.

The software is in the Proof-of-Concept stage, so no guarantees on API or stability are given. It is not a feature-complete yet as well.
